I am a software developer using zsh as my shell. My primary development tools are Neovim and tmux. I use a structured Neovim configuration based on lazy.nvim for plugin management.

I use the following tools and technologies:

*   **Shell**: zsh with Starship prompt
*   **Editor**: Neovim
*   **Terminal Multiplexer**: tmux
*   **Languages**: Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
*   **Frameworks**: Node.js, React, Next.js, Angular, Flutter
*   **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
*   **Cloud Platforms**: Google Cloud, Firebase

I am always looking for ways to improve my workflow and am open to suggestions for new tools and techniques.
