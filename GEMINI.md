I am a software developer who values an efficient and customized command-line environment.

## Core Setup

*   **Shell**: Zsh with the Starship prompt. I manage shell configurations manually and do not use a Zsh plugin framework.
*   **Editor**: Neovim, with plugins managed by `lazy.nvim`.
*   **Terminal Multiplexer**: tmux, with plugins managed by `tpm`.
*   **Dotfile Manager**: `yadm`, with my dotfiles stored on GitHub.

## Workflow & Preferences

*   I prefer modern, fast, and ergonomic CLI tools (e.g., `ripgrep`, `fd`, `zoxide`, `bat`).
*   Secrets should be managed using `yadm`'s built-in GPG encryption.
*   I value clear and maintainable configuration files.
*   **After modifying a configuration file, please commit the changes to the `yadm` repository with a descriptive message.**
*   **If keybindings or usage details change, please update `cheatsheet.md` accordingly.**

## Technologies

*   **Languages**: Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
*   **Frameworks**: Node.js, React, Next.js, Angular, Flutter
*   **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
*   **Cloud Platforms**: Google Cloud, Firebase
